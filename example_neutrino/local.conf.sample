#

# instruct bitbake to use a hash equivalence aware signature generator. Hash
# equivalence improves reuse of sstate by detecting when a given sstate
# artifact can be reused as equivalent, even if the current task hash doesn't
# match the one that generated the artifact.

# A shared hash equivalent server can be set with "<HOSTNAME>:<PORT>" format+#
